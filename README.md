# BEGAN-keras
A BEGAN implementation using idiomatic keras

[Original Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10717.pdf)

This is a working progress. The models compile and as far as I know the methodology is correct, but the results make no sense. I'm currently training it for more time, let's see how it goes.
